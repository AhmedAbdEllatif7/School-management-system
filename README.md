# School Management System

The School Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline and enhance various administrative and academic processes within educational institutions. This open-source project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for managing schools, colleges, or universities, making it easier for administrators, teachers, parents, and students to collaborate effectively.

## Features

- **Multilingual Support:** The system offers multiple language options, allowing users to switch between languages (e.g., English, Arabic). All interface elements, labels, and content are presented in the selected language, providing a localized experience for users.

- **Multi-Auth for Admin, Student, Teacher, and Parent:**

One of the powerful features of this School Management System is "Multi-Auth." It allows the application to handle multiple user authentication systems simultaneously for different user roles:

- **Admin**: School administrators have access to the admin dashboard, where they can manage users, courses, and generate reports.

- **Student**: Students can log in to access their academic records, exam schedules, and school announcements.

- **Teacher**: Teachers can log in to view their teaching schedules, manage grades, and communicate with parents.

- **Parent**: Parents can log in to monitor their child's academic progress, view exam results, and communicate with teachers.

With Multi-Auth, each user role has its own authentication mechanism, ensuring secure access to the appropriate features and information. This enhances the overall user experience and streamlines communication between stakeholders in the school community.


- **Student Management:** Maintain student records, including personal details, attendance, academic performance, and disciplinary history. Generate student reports and progress cards. 

- **Teacher Management:** Manage teacher profiles, qualifications, schedules, and performance evaluations. Assign teachers to classes and subjects.

- **Course and Curriculum Management:** Organize courses and subjects. Create and manage academic curriculum, lesson plans, and course materials.

- **Attendance Management:** Record and track student attendance. Generate attendance reports for teachers, parents, and administrators.

- **Grading and Exam Management:** Manage exam schedules, conduct exams, and evaluate student performance. Automatically calculate grades and publish results.

- **Parent Portal:** Provide parents with access to their child's attendance, grades, and academic progress. Facilitate communication between parents and teachers.

- **Fee and Finance Management:** Manage fee collection, track payments, and generate financial reports. Handle expenses and budgeting for the institution.

- **Library Management:** Maintain a catalog of library books, track borrowing and returns, and manage book availability.

- **Timetable Management:** Create and manage class schedules, teacher timetables, and exam timetables.
